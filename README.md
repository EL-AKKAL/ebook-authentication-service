## About Project

This project is a dedicated Authentication Microservice. It is designed to handle user authentication independently, following a scalable microservices architecture.

The service is responsible for receiving, retrieving, updating, and managing auth cridentials while enforcing strict user-level data isolation using JWT-based identity propagation.
